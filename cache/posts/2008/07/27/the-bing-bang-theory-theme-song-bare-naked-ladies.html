<p><html><body><blockquote><strong>The Bing Bang Theory Theme Song - Bare Naked Ladies</strong>Our whole universe was in a hot dense state,</p>
<p>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...</p>
<p>The Earth began to cool,</p>
<p>The autotrophs began to drool,</p>
<p>Neanderthals developed tools,</p>
<p>We built a wall (we built the pyramids),</p>
<p>Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries,</p>
<p>That all started with the big bang!</p>
<p>"Since the dawn of man" is really not that long,</p>
<p>As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.</p>
<p>A fraction of a second and the elements were made.</p>
<p>The bipeds stood up straight,</p>
<p>The dinosaurs all met their fate,</p>
<p>They tried to leap but they were late</p>
<p>And they all died (they froze their asses off)</p>
<p>The oceans and pangea</p>
<p>See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya</p>
<p>Set in motion by the same big bang!</p>
<p>It all started with the big BANG!</p>
<p>It's expanding ever outward but one day</p>
<p>It will cause the stars to go the other way,</p>
<p>Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it wont be hurt</p>
<p>Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!</p>
<p>Australopithecus would really have been sick of us</p>
<p>Debating out while here they're catching deer (we're catching viruses)</p>
<p>Religion or astronomy, Encarta, Deuteronomy</p>
<p>It all started with the big bang!</p>
<p>Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology</p>
<p>It all started with the big bang!</p>
<p>It all started with the big BANG!</blockquote></body></html></p>
